Dindy (DND) is useful when you are busy but still want urgent calls to come through. For example, before going to sleep you select the \"Night\" profile and start it. The first time a mobile contact calls in, Dindy silences the phone and sends an SMS reply automatically telling the caller to call again if the call is urgent. The second time the same person calls, Dindy will make the phone ring to let you know a call requires your attention.<br/><br/>Other examples where Dindy is useful are in meetings (and the phone is set to vibrate on the second call) or while driving.<br/><br/>Per-profile settings allow you to customize Dindy\'s behavior. Available settings are:<br/>- <b>Enable SMS reply-to-call</b>: when disabled, Dindy works the same but SMS messages are not sent to callers.<br/>- <b>SMS message</b>: set the message to be sent to mobile phone callers.<br/>- <b>First call</b>: set whether the phone should ring, vibrate (or both) when a caller calls for the first time.<br/>- <b>Second call</b>: set whether the phone should ring, vibrate (or both) when a caller calls for the second time.<br/>- <b>Time between calls</b>: set the timeframe between the first and second call during which a call is considered urgent. It is advised to let the caller know this timeframe in the SMS message. Available options are 5 minutes, 10 minutes, half an hour, one hour and until Dindy is stopped. For the latter option, Dindy will activate the second call notification for every caller that calls more than once until Dindy is stopped.<br/>- <b>Non-mobile caller</b>: this setting tells Dindy how to treat incoming calls that are in your contact list but are not listed as mobile. The choices are to use the first call settings, the second call settings or your regular call settings from before you started Dindy.<br/>- <b>Unknown caller</b>: this setting tells Dindy how to treat incoming calls from unknown callers (that are not in your contact list.) The choices are to use the first call settings, the second call settings or your regular call settings from before you started Dindy.<br/>- <b>Use time limit</b>: check this option to be asked for a time limit every time the profile is started. The profile will stop automatically according to your setting. Time limit only works from the main screen or widgets. When started from a shortcut, a profile will start with no limit.<br/><br/>Additional notes:<br/>- Dindy will not send the automatic SMS reply message if the incoming call was accepted or declined.<br/>- Alarms will go off while Dindy is running even if it was set to silence the ringer (so, for example, you can set an alarm to wake you up even if the current profile silences the phone.)<br/>- Incoming text messages will make a notification sound and vibrate according to the first call notification settings of the active profile.<br/><br/><b>Using Dindy shortcuts</b><br/>A Dindy profile shortcut can be used to start and then stop the same profile. The \"Stop Dindy\" shortcut can be used to stop any running profile.<br/>When using Dindy shortcuts in external applications, after deleting a profile or after uninstalling and reinstalling Dindy you must re-apply all of Dindy\'s settings in these applications (upgrades are safe).<br/>Important note to AppAlarm users: when using Dindy with AppAlarm, UNCHECK the \"Force App Restart On Launch\" option. Failing to do so will leave your phone silent!<br/><br/><b>Using Dindy in Locale</b><br/>To correctly use Dindy in Locale add the \"Stop Dindy\" setting to each situation where you do NOT want to use Dindy, specifically the default situation.<br/>For each situation where you want to use Dindy, add the desired Dindy profile setting.<br/>After deleting a Dindy profile that is used in Locale you must change the Dindy setting in the relevant situations. If you uninstall and reinstall Dindy, you must re-apply all of Dindy\'s settings in Locale (Dindy upgrades are safe).<br/><br/>Dindy was conceived and created by Amit Schreiber (aka gnobal).
